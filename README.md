# sysMonDash-android
sysMonDash application for Android devices written in Kotlin

---

**Beta release**

You can now stay up to date on which events are being received by the sysMonDash server by connecting this app to its web API.


If you need to test some features, you could use the SMD demo server API by setting:

- URL: http://sysmondash.cygnux.org:11080/
- API Token: gJBHeGyvu1ym4KzIHsZDUj81Z8ecHKNQ

It uses a "dummy" backed that has some predefined events and generates a random event timestamp every 2 hours.
